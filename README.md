So my client was an airline firm that collects booking manually from customers and  the ticket staffs takes them manually also to the ticketing manager for approval & receipts.
I built an app to collect data from the customers and then upon submission, the manager receives an email and a link that will take him to the powerBi service for the report or he can view the report on PowerBi mobile.


Power Platform indeed is a lifesaver for businesses.
